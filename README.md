Ever wanted to make a discord overlay but too lazy to think of a name? No worries!

// HOW TO RUN THE APPLICATION

Extract the .ZIP file, and go to "dist." the "nonsource.exe" file should be there, just double click it. Then go to discord's user settings, registered games, click on "Add It!" and then go to something that would say three or two random words. eg. "Plant 2001" or "Car Tycoon 2011"

// NECESSITIES

You need Python 3.11.1
